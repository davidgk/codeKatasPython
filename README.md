# Code Katas Python

the blank folder is the one for starting from scratch 

the idea is:

1. Copy that folder with the name of Kata
2. execute this commands:
```bash
    cd your_new_kata_folder;
    source project.sh;
    replace_kata_name your_new_kata_folder
```
3. Start Playing! Use TDD and commit often
