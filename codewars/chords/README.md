# definition of CHORDS

we become revel and we wanted to rename the sounds 
We have known that the musical notes are twelve tones until the same sound is repeated but higher or lower.
the new names we call them are:

From low to high, separated by half tone we have this sequence until it's repeated again but higher sound
light
    light-plus
lord 
    lord -plus
rings
    rings-plus
magic
    magic-plus
energy
    energy-plus
enlight
    enlight-plus
darkness 

between each note exist a tone, but between rings and magic and darkness and light are separated by half a tone.
A basic chord is composed by three notes. 
We have major and minor tones:
* major: from first to third one we should have 2 tones, and from third to fifth we have a tone and a half
* minor: from first to third one we should have a tone and a half, and from third to fifth we have 2 tones
